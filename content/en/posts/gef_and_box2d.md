This was my last project for Year 2. Purpose of the project is to demonstrate knowledge and proficiency by using and manipulating textured 3D geometry, multiple interactable game states and physics interactions using the Box2D library (3D objects on a 2D plane) and the GEF framework.
</br>

Gameplay wise you have a player ship and respawnable enemies. The goal is to survive for as long as possible while getting the highest score you can. There are collision based physics interactions between the player, enemies, bullets and ground. A spin I added is that you can manipulate the bullets while they are flying. You as the player decide in which direction they fly and it can be changes mid air.

The biggest thing I learned from this project was how to make my own class based State Machine. Apart from the state machine was interesting to use the Box2D library for the first time and not have to write my own collision.
