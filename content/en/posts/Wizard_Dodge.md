## Purpose
This project has a very simple goal - publish a game. Up until this project I had learned and developed how to create individual systems and mechanics, never a full game. I had tried before, but I went into rabbit holes of creating and coding the mechanic and adding more and more stuff, thus the goal of this project was to keep it **very simple**  in order to avoid overdeveloping mechanics and never actually publishing the project. If I want to explore the mechanics further, I said to myself I will do that **after**  the game has been published via updates. 

Another goal of the project was for me to learn how to make games for mobile via Unity as well as integrate and setup Ads. Next up on the plan is to learn how to add Google Play Services via a future update to the game.

## Current State
The game currently has:
- A main gameplay loop - dodging falling boxes and trying to survive for as long as possible
- A Main Menu
- UI
- End Game Screen and state for when the player dies
- Ads support
- Scaling difficulty - the longer you survive for, the harder it gets

### Upcoming Update
Features I am currently working on are:
- An Options Screen - where for now you will be able to change between 2 control schemes
- A Credits Screen - where I will credit all assets I have used which are not mine
- Fixing some known bugs such as the timer resetting to 0 after reaching 60 seconds

### Short-Midterm Plans
- Fix any bugs that arise
- Add support for Google Services - Achievements/Leaderboards
- Save the "High Score" for the player
- Add music and sound effects
- Improve difficulty scaling
- Start showing game to more people to gather feedback

## Conclusion
This is a project I am quite proud of and will probably have a special place in my heart, not because of it's complexity or amazing graphics or gameplay, but because it will always remain the very first game I have published. I want to keep improving it and use it as a good project to continue learning with, there are many mechanics I could still add. Now that I have free time and not stressing over University Projects, I can work on improving this game (and another one I have been making in the background with an artist friend of mine :) )
