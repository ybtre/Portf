This was the very first game I made when I got into University. It was made as a project for the CMP105 Games Course (Link for the module description below).

The game was made utilizing the SFML Library and C++.

As my very first game I learned quite a bit, and I also messed up quite a lot. It was a good introduction into the of games programming which is also what sparked my interest to continue learning and wanting to get better at it. 
  
Every project is a stepping stone onto and this project was my first step into the world of game programming.
