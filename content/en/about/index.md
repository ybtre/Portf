##### My name is Hristo and I am a final year Computer Games Application Development student at Abertay University. In this website you can find a combination of my Portfolio as well as blog posts I write.

Since a very young age I have been playing video games. The more I played the more interested I became in how they are made and wanted to learn how to make them. This is reason why after graduation High School I enrolled into Abertay University to study Computer Game Application Development. The more I study about games and how they are made the more passionate I become about it. It is my dream job and am constantly working on new side projects to further my skills and knowledge in the industry.
