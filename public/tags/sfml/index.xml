        <description>For this module we had to network a game using any networking API. During the classes we were taught winsock and SFML. For my coursework I decided to use my year 1 asteroids game as a base and add networking using SFML on top.
The Network Architecture I chose for the projcet was Server-Client. Reasoning being that it scales easier than P2P. It is more secure, because the Server has to verify the data from the players and more stable if a Client crashes, thus not affecting the other Clients if the host-client crashes by mistake in P2P.</description>

        <description>This was the very first game I made when I got into University. It was made as a project for the CMP105 Games Course (Link for the module description below).
The game was made utilizing the SFML Library and C++.
As my very first game I learned quite a bit, and I also messed up quite a lot. It was a good introduction into the of games programming which is also what sparked my interest to continue learning and wanting to get better at it.</description>
